For the Onion Service:
	- sign the Onion Service descriptor
		ECDSA {
		   privkey := private part of the key in its address
		}

	- verify one-time secret + rdv address ??
	
	- connect to the rdv point
		trame?
	

For the client:
	- verify a descriptor signature (with the address of the service)
	- send a one-time secret to the rendez-vous point
		ECDSA {
		   pubkey := point address
		},
		secret = ??

	- send the same one-time secret and the rendez-vous address to the service through one of the introduction points
		AES {
		   key := successive encryption of the public keys of the different nodes (backwards)
		},
		secret = ??
		rdv_addr := point address
		
	-


For the rendez-vous point:
	- match the secrets from both sides
